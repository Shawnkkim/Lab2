This project is building a web mapping application which show building permits in Calgary. Users will be able to filter and visualze building permits within Calgary by using a date range picker widget. City of Calgary's Open Calgary APi was used to pull in building permits data. Users will be able to query for date ranges through the Open Calgary API.
